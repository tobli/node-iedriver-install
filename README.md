# IEDriver install

[![Build status][appveyor-image]][appveyor-url]

This is a simple package that downloads [IEDriver](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver) and 
provides a node api for accessing the path to the binary. There are other packages like this, but I wanted to make sure
I had an updated package to include in [Browsertime](http://www.browsertime.net).
